# covid-19-tweets-ke

his project aims to investigate the nature of online discourse on Kenyan twitter regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Kenyan twittersphere is remrkably fluid, with moments of online solidarity as frequent as moments of extreme polarisation. This project seeks to understand whether conversations about COVID-19 have been tainted by the usual propaganda common in Kenyan twittersphere, or 'tweeps' have been level headed in their discourse.

This is an ongoing project, and in future, I intend to use Sentiment Analysis, Word Embedding and Topic Modeling for further analysis on this dataset.
